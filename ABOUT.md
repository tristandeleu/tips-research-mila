### Guidelines

* Try to be succinct and explicit
* Put yourself in the shoes of the very diverse crowd of _new_ students: they come from different geographical, social, cultural and educational backgrounds.
* It's ok to have a different opinion from what's already there. If you can explain in a simple sentence why this is the case, it will be more helpful for more junior students.
* The documents are written in Markdown. If you're familiar with Sphinx, know that you'll also be able to use rst.
  * You can use rst-in-markdown with [MyST](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
